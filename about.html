                <p class="text_info">
                    I first touched clay during a beginner’s wheel class on a
                    date. I didn’t expect it to stick, but that two-hour session
                    turned into a quiet obsession. Since then, I’ve kept
                    returning to the wheel. Today, I split my time between a
                    small home studio and a local community space, where I
                    continue to learn and shape each piece by hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Brooklyn, where stillness had to be created,
                    not found. I’ve always found calm in caring for houseplants
                    and surrounding myself with natural textures. Working with
                    clay gives me that same sense of quiet focus. It invites
                    patience, presence, and care. These values show up in my
                    work, which leans toward simplicity and function. I’m drawn
                    to soft forms, muted glazes, and earthy palettes that
                    reflect the quiet beauty of everyday life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My pieces are shaped by intention and made with the hope
                    that they bring a sense of ease into the moments that matter
                    most. Whether it's a quiet morning or a shared meal, I'm
                    grateful when something I've made becomes part of someone
                    else's rhythm.
                </p>
