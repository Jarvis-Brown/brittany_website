            <p>
                I am particularly drawn to the imperfections and uniqueness of
                handmade pottery, where each slight variation tells its own
                story. The tactile qualities of clay and the slow, deliberate
                rhythm of working with my hands allow me to focus on
                craftsmanship and the intimate relationship between maker and
                material. As a beginner, I am constantly learning, experimenting
                with different techniques and glazes to develop my own style. My
                work is inspired by the natural worldâ€”earth tones, flowing
                lines, and simple, elegant forms that invite interaction. I aim
                to create pieces that are not only visually pleasing but also
                functional and comforting in everyday use. Ultimately, my goal
                is to craft pottery that encourages a deeper connection with the
                objects we use, fostering an appreciation for the handmade and
                the beauty found in the imperfect.
